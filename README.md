# Skedulo Tech Test Submission

## Overview

Hi! This is my submission for technical test.
In this submission, I have installed date-fn library to format the start date and end date. I also use boostrap to style table which showed the list of jobs.

To not show any data and clear result when no more than 3 characters have been entered, i thought about 'debounce technique' but turned out it was as simple as 'searchJob.length < 3' can solve the requirement perfectly.
This test is a great opportunity for me to learn more about typescript interface since a lot of projects I worked before mostly with rest-api.

Finally, unfortunately this test came along with 2 other tests from my classes at school which will be happened this week. So I couldn't at more testcase.

Thank you for reading my overview about the test. Iam looking forward to your reviews.
